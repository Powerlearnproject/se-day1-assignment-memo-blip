#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods for development and maintenance of high quality software. It enables creation of software applications and systems used in various aspects such as healthcare and commerce.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
The development of programming languages 
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline
The introduction of structured programming
The rise of agile methodologies
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design- creating detailed design of software architecture and user interface
implementation- writing code and building the software according to design specifications
Testing- conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards
Deployment- releasing the software to users
Maintenance- providing ongoing support and updates after the software is deployed.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodologies is where the phases distinctively follow a sequential approach
The agile methodology is a step by step approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration and adapting to change
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes code and implements software solutions
A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code for example visual studio
Version Control Systems allow for tracking changes to source code and coordination with team members
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements during the development cycle lesding to project delays. This can be overcome by effective communication
Tight deadlines leading to rushed development and compromised quality. This can be overcome by regular reassessment of project goals and timelines
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual software components
Integration testing is testing interactions between different software components
System testing is testing the software as a whole
acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure they are met
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions to get the best responses from AI models. It helps to improve the interaction between humans and AI models
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Teach me about the data link layer
Teach me about the working of the Ethernet switches and their interaction with MAC addresses.
The improved prompted is more specific and targeted and therefore a deeper level response is expected
